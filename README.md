# Inventory Management System üßæüì¶

A full-stack web app using:

- ‚öõÔ∏è React + TypeScript (frontend)
- üêç .NET 8 Web API + Entity Framework (backend)
- üóÉÔ∏è SQL Server

## Features
- Add products
- View inventory
- Real-time sync
- CORS enabled

## Setup
Run the helper script to install .NET, Node.js and Vite:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Getting Started

```bash
cd backend/InventoryApi
# optionally set DB_CONNECTION_STRING to override the default SQL Server connection
dotnet run

cd frontend/inventory-ui
npm install
# copy .env.example to .env and update the value if your backend runs elsewhere
npm run dev
```

The `.env` file in `frontend/inventory-ui` defines `VITE_API_URL`.
Edit this value to point the React app at a different backend server.

The backend can read its SQL Server connection from the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`
environment variable. If not set, it falls back to the connection string in
`appsettings.json`.

## Database Setup
1. Ensure a running SQL Server instance.
2. Execute `database/schema.sql` to create the tables.
3. Set `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` to override the default connection string.

## Reports

The backend exposes `GET /api/reports/inventory` which returns the current
inventory as a CSV file. A small helper script is provided to fetch this data
and save it locally.

```bash
pip install -r reports/requirements.txt
python reports/generate_report.py
```

Set `API_BASE_URL` if your backend runs on a different URL (defaults to
`http://localhost:5204`).

## What I learnt

Building this app is a solid exercise for a new programmer. Through setting up
the backend and frontend, you can learn how a React UI communicates with a
.NET API using REST calls. The project demonstrates how environment variables
configure connections to external services like SQL Server, and how scripts are
used to manage dependencies. You'll also get practice working with basic CRUD
data in a relational database and running the app locally through the provided
setup instructions.

This architecture also introduces beginners to principles of scalable data handling. Separating the React front end from the .NET API shows how large datasets can be managed efficiently while keeping the UI responsive. The layered setup teaches you how to build apps that remain performant as data and traffic grow.
